              <br /><br />
              Saturn's environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The
              temperatures, pressures, and materials that characterize this
              planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to
              adapt to.
              <br /><br />
              While planet Saturn is an unlikely place for living things to take
              hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Satellites
              like Enceladus and Titan, home to internal oceans, could possibly
              support life.

            </div>
            <p class="cont-txt">
              Saturn's rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids, or
              shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn
              apart by Saturn's powerful gravity. They are made of billions of
              small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as
              dust.
              <br /><br />
              The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains
              to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as
              mountains. The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them
              from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits
              at a different speed around the planet.

              <strong>Saturn's ring</strong> system extends up to 175,000 miles
              (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is
              typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named
              alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are
              relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap
              measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width called the
              Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are
              A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently
              discovered. <br /><br />
              Starting at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C
              ring, B ring, Cassini Division, A ring, F ring, G ring, and
              finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the very faint
              Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn's moon Phoebe.
