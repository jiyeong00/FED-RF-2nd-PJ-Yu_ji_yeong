          The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite.<br />
          It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), about 30
          times the diameter of Earth.<br />
          Over time Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, causing the same
          side of the Moon to always face Earth.<br />
          Because of this, the lunar day and the lunar month are the same
          length, at 29.5 Earth days.<br />
          The Moon's gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the Sun's –
          are the main drivers of Earth's tides.

            natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km
            (238,900 mi), about 30 times the diameter of Earth. Over time
            Earth's gravity has caused tidal locking, causing the same side of
            the Moon to always face Earth. Because of this, the lunar day and
            the lunar month are the same length, at 29.5 Earth days. The Moon's
            gravitational pull – and to a lesser extent, the Sun's – are the
            main drivers of Earth's tides. In geophysical terms the Moon is a
            planetary-mass object or satellite planet. Its mass is 1.2% that of
            the Earth, and its diameter is 3,474 km (2,159 mi), roughly
            one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as Australia.) Within the
            Solar System, it is the largest and most massive satellite in
            relation to its parent planet, the fifth largest and most massive
            moon overall, and larger and more massive than all known dwarf
            planets. Its surface gravity is about one sixth of Earth's, about
            half of that of Mars, and the second highest among all Solar System
            moons, after Jupiter's moon Io. The body of the Moon is
            differentiated and terrestrial, with no significant hydrosphere,
            atmosphere, or magnetic field. It formed 4.51 billion years ago, not
            long after Earth's formation, out of the debris from a giant impact
            between Earth and a hypothesized Mars-sized body called Theia. The
            lunar surface is covered in lunar dust and marked by mountains,
            impact craters, their ejecta, ray-like streaks and, mostly on the
            near side of the Moon, by dark maria ("seas"), which are plains of
            cooled magma. These maria were formed when molten lava flowed into
            ancient impact basins. The Moon is, except when passing through
            Earth's shadow during a lunar eclipse, always illuminated by the
            Sun, but from Earth the visible illumination shifts during its
            orbit, producing the lunar phases. The Moon is the brightest
            celestial object in Earth's night sky. This is mainly due to its
            large angular diameter, while the reflectance of the lunar surface
            is comparable to that of asphalt. The apparent size is nearly the
            same as that of the Sun, allowing it to cover the Sun completely
            during a total solar eclipse. From Earth about 59% of the lunar
            surface is visible over time due to cyclical shifts in perspective
            (libration), making parts of the far side of the Moon visible. For
            humans the Moon has been an important source of inspiration and
            knowledge, having been crucial to cosmography, mythology, religion,
            art, time keeping, natural science, and spaceflight. On September
            13, 1959, the first human-made object to reach an extraterrestrial
            body arrived on the Moon, the Soviet Union's Luna 2 impactor. In
            1966, the Moon became the first extraterrestrial body where soft
            landings and orbital insertions were achieved. On July 20, 1969,
            humans for the first time landed on the Moon and any
            extraterrestrial body, at Mare Tranquillitatis with the lander Eagle
            of the United States' Apollo 11 mission. Five more crews were sent
            between then and 1972, each with two men landing on the surface. The
            longest stay was 75 hours by the Apollo 17 crew. Since then,
            exploration of the Moon has continued robotically with crewed
            missions being planned to return beginning in the late 2020s.

            The Apollo Program was an American manned lunar exploration plan led
            by NASA from 1961 to 1972. Through this, humans set foot on the moon
            six times between 1969 and 1972. When John F. Kennedy took office in
            1961, he launched the program to send humans to the moon in the 1960s,
            instantly turning over the space race that had lagged behind the
            Soviet Union. The launch site is also called Kennedy Space Center.
            'Direct arrival', which involves landing and taking off directly from
            the moon with a very large 4-stage rocket originally conceived by
            NASA; 'Earth orbit rendezvous', which involves assembling various
            hulls raised by multiple rockets in Earth orbit; and 2 rockets with
            and without an astronaut and a lander. The 'Lunar Surface Rendezvous',
            which is sent to the moon separately, is reversed, and the command
            module, machine module, and lunar probe are launched with one rocket,
            and only the lunar probe lands in the lunar orbit, and then the
            command and the upper stage of the lunar probe return to the 'lunar
            orbit rendezvous'. This is the mission that first sent humans to the
            moon.
